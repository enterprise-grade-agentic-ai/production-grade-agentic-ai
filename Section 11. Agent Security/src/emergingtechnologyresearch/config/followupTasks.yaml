    User has requested: {prompt}.
    User Requested Style in the prompt: {style}.
    User conversation history: {history}
    User ActorId: {actorId}
    Analyse the user prompt - {prompt}. After that answer the question based on the already conducted research
    aligning with the user prompt. But if the user is asking explicitly only for the reports already published
    and then use appropriate published reports tool, and don't consider conversation history in that case.
